      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>As BTech student in Computer Science Engineering at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology,<br>
       I am passionate about learning and applying the fundamentals of programming, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering.<br>
        I have a strong interest and skill in C++, which I have demonstrated by earning an advanced certification from Udemy and completing multiple projects using object-oriented principles and concepts.</p>

      <p>I am also committed to using my technical knowledge and skills to address social causes and real-world problems.<br>
         Currently, I am volunteering at Foodation India, a non-profit organization that aims to reduce food waste and hunger in India.</p>
